# Supabase

<Info>
[Supabase](https://supabase.com/docs) is an open-source backend-as-a-service (BaaS) platform designed to make it easier for developers to build scalable and feature-rich applications. It provides developers with a complete set of backend tools without requiring them to maintain custom-built solutions.

<Warning>
We've decided to implement the self-hosted version of Supabase as part of the Launchpad for enhanced control and customization.
