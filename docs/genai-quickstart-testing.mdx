Before deploying your workflow, it's essential to test it locally. GenAI Launchpad provides a convenient playground for testing and debugging workflows without going through the full API pipeline.

## Local Testing Setup

The testing infrastructure consists of:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Test Events" icon="file-code">
    Pre-defined test payloads in `requests/events` folder that match your schema
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Workflow Playground" icon="play">
    Python script at `playground/workflow_playground.py` for direct workflow execution
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Running a Test

To test your workflow locally, use the following simple pattern:

```python
event = EventFactory.create_event(event_key="product")
workflow = CustomerCareWorkflow()
result = workflow.run(event)
```

<Info>
The `event_key` parameter corresponds to a JSON file name in the `requests/events` directory. For example, `event_key="product"` loads `requests/events/product.json`.
</Info>

## Test Event Examples

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Product Query">
    ```json
    {
      "from_email": "customer@example.com",
      "to_email": "support@company.com",
      "sender": "Jane Smith",
      "subject": "Question about product features",
      "body": "I'm interested in your premium plan. Can you tell me what features are included?"
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Billing Issue">
    ```json
    {
      "from_email": "user@example.com",
      "to_email": "billing@company.com",
      "sender": "John Doe",
      "subject": "Invoice request",
      "body": "I need a copy of my invoice from last month for accounting purposes."
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Spam Message">
    ```json
    {
      "from_email": "spam@bot.com",
      "to_email": "support@company.com",
      "sender": "Bot123",
      "subject": "$$$ MAKE MONEY FAST $$$",
      "body": "Click here for amazing deals! Limited time offer!!!"
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Benefits of Local Testing

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Immediate Feedback">
    See results instantly without waiting for async processing or checking databases
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Easy Debugging">
    Add breakpoints and step through your workflow logic in your IDE
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="No Dependencies">
    Test without running Docker containers, Celery workers, or databases
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Rapid Iteration">
    Quickly modify and test workflow logic without restarting services
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Creating Custom Test Events

To add your own test events:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create JSON file">
    Add a new JSON file to `requests/events/` with your test data
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Match schema">
    Ensure the JSON structure matches your event schema exactly
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Reference by name">
    Use the filename (without .json) as the `event_key` in EventFactory
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Testing Different Scenarios

<Warning>
Always test edge cases including:
- Invalid or missing data
- Spam detection scenarios
- Various intent classifications
- Error conditions
</Warning>

## Debugging Tips

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Add Logging" icon="terminal">
    Insert `logging.info()` statements in your nodes to track execution flow
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Print Context" icon="bug">
    Use `print(task_context.nodes)` to inspect intermediate results
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Test Individual Nodes" icon="puzzle-piece">
    You can test single nodes in isolation before combining them
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Check AI Responses" icon="robot">
    Verify that AI outputs match your expected structure
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Example Test Script

Here's a complete example of testing multiple scenarios:

```python
from playground.event_factory import EventFactory
from workflows.customer_care_workflow import CustomerCareWorkflow
import logging

# Configure logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO)

# Test different event types
test_events = ["product", "billing", "spam", "refund"]

for event_key in test_events:
    print(f"\n--- Testing {event_key} event ---")
    
    # Create and run workflow
    event = EventFactory.create_event(event_key=event_key)
    workflow = CustomerCareWorkflow()
    result = workflow.run(event)
    
    # Display results
    print(f"Workflow completed: {result.success}")
    if result.error:
        print(f"Error: {result.error}")
```

<Tip>
Run tests with different log levels (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`) to control the amount of output you see during testing.
</Tip>

## Next Steps

Once you've successfully tested your workflow locally, you're ready to perform end-to-end testing with the full system.
