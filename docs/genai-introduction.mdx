The GenAI Launchpad is a production-ready boilerplate for building event-driven AI applications. It bridges the gap between proof-of-concept AI integrations and production-ready systems by providing a robust, scalable architecture that handles all the complex infrastructure pieces developers typically need to build from scratch.

## What GenAI Launchpad Is

At its core, GenAI Launchpad is an architectural framework that provides:

  <Card title="Event-Driven Foundation" icon="bolt">
    Every interaction flows through a consistent event workflow:
    - Events enter through FastAPI endpoints
    - Get persisted in PostgreSQL
    - Process through Celery workers
    - Results stored in database
    - Optional callbacks notify external systems
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="AI Integration Framework" icon="robot">
    Built-in abstractions for working with:
    - PydanticAI for accessing different LLM models
    - Prompt management and versioning
    - Flexible agent configurations
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Production Infrastructure" icon="server">
    Ready-to-use components including:
    - Supabase for database, auth and realtime
    - Alembic for database migrations
    - Redis for caching and task queues
    - Celery background tasks
    - Caddy as reverse proxy
    - Docker for deployments
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## What GenAI Launchpad Is Not

<Warning>
**Not an Agent Framework**: While you can build agent-like systems using our workflow architecture, GenAI Launchpad isn't primarily an agent framework like AutoGPT, CrewAI, or LangGraph. Instead, it provides the infrastructure to build any type of AI application, including but not limited to agents. All of the mentioned frameworks can be easily integrated into the launchpad, which is what we have done with PydanticAI.
</Warning>

<Info>
**Not Opinionated About AI Logic**: We don't dictate how you should implement your AI logic. Our workflow system is flexible enough to work with any approach:
- Use our built-in workflow system
- Integrate LangChain
- Implement LlamaIndex
- Build custom solutions
</Info>

<Tip>
**Not a Closed System**: Every component is designed to be replaceable:
- Replace Redis with RabbitMQ
- Use different model providers
- Implement custom workflow processors
- Integrate with MCP servers
</Tip>

<Note>
The GenAI Launchpad is a complete foundation for building production-grade AI applications. Whether you're building a simple AI-powered API or a complex event-driven system, GenAI Launchpad provides the infrastructure you need to focus on your unique business logic rather than reinventing the wheel.
