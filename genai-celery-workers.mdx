# Celery Workers

<Info>
Celery is used to run background tasks, making it ideal for event-driven architectures like Launchpad. It supports features such as task scaling, custom queuing mechanisms, and retries, providing flexibility and robustness.

## Key Benefits

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Event-Driven Approach" icon="workflow">
    <div>
      **Event-Driven Approach**: Enables the decoupling of components for a responsive and scalable architecture.
    </div>
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Horizontal Scaling" icon="arrows-expand">
    <div>
      **Scaling**: Simplifies horizontal scaling to handle increased workloads seamlessly.
    </div>
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Custom Queuing" icon="queue-list">
    <div>
      **Custom Queuing**: Allows the implementation of tailored task queuing and retry mechanisms.
