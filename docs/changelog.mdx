## Getting Started

<Info>
Follow our [quickstart guide](/v1.0.0/genai-quickstart-overview) to build your first AI workflow in minutes.
</Info>

## System Requirements

- Python 3.12+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- 8GB RAM minimum (16GB recommended)
- Node.js v19+ (for Mintlify documentation)

## Breaking Changes from Beta

<Warning>
If upgrading from beta versions (v0.9.x), note these breaking changes:
- Workflow schema structure has been updated
- AgentNode now requires async/await patterns
- Database schema changes require fresh migration
</Warning>

## Migration Guide

For users upgrading from v0.9.x:

1. Back up your database
2. Update workflow definitions to new schema format
3. Convert synchronous AgentNode implementations to async
4. Run new migrations with `./migrate.sh`
5. Update environment variables for new configuration

## Known Limitations

- MCP server integration is experimental
- Streaming responses require WebSocket support
- Maximum concurrent workers limited by Redis memory

## Next Release Preview

Version 1.1.0 (planned Q2 2025) will include:
- Enhanced streaming capabilities
- Built-in RAG support
- Workflow visualization dashboard
- Advanced monitoring and metrics
