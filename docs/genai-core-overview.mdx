# Core Package Overview

<Info>
The `core` package is the central component of the application, providing a flexible and extensible framework for defining and executing workflows. It implements a directed acyclic graph (DAG) based workflow system where tasks flow through a series of processing nodes, each performing specific operations on the task context.
</Info>

## Package Structure

The `core` package consists of the following components:

## Key Features

<Accordion title="Workflow Orchestration">
  The core package provides powerful workflow orchestration capabilities that allow you to define complex processing pipelines with multiple interconnected nodes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Task Context Management">
  Centralized state management through the TaskContext system ensures data flows seamlessly between workflow nodes while maintaining state integrity.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Node-based Architecture">
  Modular node-based design enables reusable processing components that can be easily combined to create sophisticated workflows.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Schema Validation">
  Built-in validation ensures workflow schemas are properly structured and form valid directed acyclic graphs before execution.
