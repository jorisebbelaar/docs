# Schemas

<Info>
In this project, we utilize **Pydantic models** to validate event data systematically. Each workflow in the Launchpad must define its own Pydantic schema.
</Info>

<Card title="Data Validation Benefits" icon="shield-check">
This approach ensures that incoming data is validated at the **endpoint level** and supports validation within the workflow definition.
</Card>

## Key Advantages

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Cleaner Code" icon="code">
    Structured validation reduces complexity
  </Card>
  <Card title="Data Consistency" icon="database">
    Prevents data inconsistencies across workflows
  </Card>
  <Card title="Improved Robustness" icon="shield">
    Enhanced reliability of workflows
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Tip>
By adhering to this Pydantic schema approach, we achieve cleaner code, reduce the likelihood of data inconsistencies, and improve the robustness of our workflows.
