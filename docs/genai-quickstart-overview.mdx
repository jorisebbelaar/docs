description: "Build your first GenAI workflow - a customer care automation system"
---

The quickstart guide demonstrates how GenAI Launchpad works through a pre-implemented customer care use case. You won't need to write any code yourself; instead, this guide walks you through the steps required to build your own workflows.

## General Development Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define an event schema">
    Create a Pydantic model that defines the structure of your incoming data
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Implement the endpoint">
    Build a FastAPI endpoint that receives events and triggers workflow processing
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Build the workflow">
    Design and implement the workflow logic using various node types
  </Step>
</Steps>

## What We're Building

In this quickstart, we'll explore a customer care automation system that:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Analyzes Tickets" icon="magnifying-glass">
    Processes incoming support tickets through intelligent analysis
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Filters Spam" icon="shield">
    Detects and filters out spam messages automatically
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Routes Intelligently" icon="route">
    Makes smart routing decisions based on ticket content
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Generates Responses" icon="message">
    Creates appropriate AI-powered responses to customer queries
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Getting Started

<Info>
We assume you've already completed the [installation steps](/genai-installation) in the previous chapter.
</Info>

To access the quickstart code, switch to the quickstart branch:

```bash
git checkout quickstart && git pull
```

<Note>
The quickstart branch contains a fully implemented example that you can run immediately to see the launchpad in action.
